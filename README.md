This app will transfer notifications from selected apps on your phone to your Http servers. The servers will then receive a json containing information about the app and the notification like the label, package name, title, message, progress (if available) and other useful information, as well the app icon's dominant color. The idea behind this project is to light up RGB strips, when receiving a message or a call, with the app icon's main color, but it can also be used for other purposes.

Like all my apps, it has the OneUI design thanks to our [libraries](https://github.com/OneUIProject).

If this app is installed as a system app, it will also show up in the system notification settings.
